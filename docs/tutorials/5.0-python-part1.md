## Assignment instructions:

The assignment this week lives inside a new jupyter notebook that has been added to the
[hackers-test/hack-5-python](https://github.com/hackers-test/hack-5-python) repository 
which you forked on github and cloned to your local machine for last weeks homework. 
Because we 'forked' this repository, the question arises, How do we get this new code 
into our own personal fork?

### A note on git forks

When you create a 'fork' of a repository you are creating an exact copy of the original,
and then disconnecting your fork from it from that point on (it's like a 'fork in the road'). 
In other words, the fork and the forked repo will almost certiainly begin to 
diverge as commits accumulate in one and not the other. Sometimes it is useful 
to 're-join' or pull in the commits from the upstream repository (the original 
forked repo), and this is what we will do here.

## Syncing a fork to an upstream repository
Because the new homework lives in the repository that you originally forked from
you must sync your repository to the original remote repo.

1 - Change directory to your local copy of the fork of the `hack-5-python` repo

2 -  Specify the original 'hack-5-python' repository as a new remote upstream for syncing

```
# View the currently attached remotes
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/iao2122/hack-5-python.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/iao2122/hack-5-python.git (push)
```

```
# Add the upstream as a new remote
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/hackers-test/hack-5-python.git

# Verify the new remote is set
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/iao2122/hack-5-python.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/iao2122/hack-5-python.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/hackers-test/hack-5-python.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/hackers-test/hack-5-python.git (push)
```

3 - Merge the changes from upstream to your local forked copy

```
# Verify that you are on your local forks 'main' branch
$ git branch  
* main

# If you are not on main you can switch to it like this:
$ git checkout main
```

```
# Now merge the upstream 'main' and your local 'main'
git merge upstream/main

# It may prompt you to include a message for the merge commit.
```

4 - Push the merge up to to the remote of your own fork
```
$ git push
```

5 - Start a jupyter notebook server locally.  
6 - Navigate to `~/hacks/hack-5-python/notebooks/`  
7 - Complete the challenges in the new notebook `nb-5.3-seesion5-challenges.ipynb`  
8 - Add, commit, and push changes back to your `origin main` copy of the repo.
