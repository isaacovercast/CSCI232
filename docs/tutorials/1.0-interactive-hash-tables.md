# Interactive hash table exploration

## Learning objectives
By the end of this session you will develop experience with:  

- Understanding two basic hash table collision resolution strategies
    - Separate chaining  
    - Linear probing  
- Inserting, removing, and searching hash tables of these types  
- Understaning load factor and how it is calculated

## Launch the VisuAlgo hash table exploration tool

[Visu**algo**](https://visualgo.net/en) is a wonderful, interactive, online tool
for understanding the structure and functioning of numerous common data structures
and algorithms using intuitive visualizations.

Launch the [hash table explorer](https://visualgo.net/en/hashtable) in a new tab.

## Separate Chaining

Upon launching Visu**Algo** you'll be dropped into the Separate Chaining
'e-Lecture Mode'. You can exit this mode and enter 'Exploration Mode' by
simply clicking anywhere in the window outside the explanatory dialogue
pop-up. By default, you will it will populate the window with a new Hash Table
with random values for number of 'buckets' (`M`), and a random number of
items (`N`). Let's start by creating a new Hash Table with the same number of
buckets and items so we can all be looking at the same thing.

In the lower left there is a panel for applying different functions to
the simulation. Choose `Create(M, N)`. Set `M` = 10 and `N` = 20, and push
**Go**. The interface will populate with a new 10 bucket hash table, and
20 random integer values. Because we are so used to counting in base 10,
it's easy to see that the *compression function* being used is simply
`mod M` (the least significant digit of each *key* equals the index of
the bucket it is stored in).

After you create a new Separate Chaining hash table you should see something
like this, an array of buckets indexed 1-9, and a list of items within each
bucket.

### Separate Chaining Search


### Separate Chaining Insert
Before inserting an item, try to predict which bucket it will go into.

### Separate Chaining Remove

Pick the bucket in your hash table with the most items and identify the
last item in the bucket, and imagine you want to remove this item. In 
the lower-left open the function pane and choose `Remove(v)`
Try removing an item that doesn't exit.

In this instance, the VisuAlgo team has decided to implement the buckets
as doubly-linked lists, which is smart because it means removing items from
the hash table will be really fast.

### Separate Chaining Load Factor
The Visu**Algo** interface also does a nice thing in automatically calculating
and presenting the *Load Factor* of this hash table. Recall from the reading
that load factor 
(α = N/M = 2.0)

<b>On differences in notation</b></p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
Notice that reading uses slightly different notation (λ = n/N), where <em>λ</em> is 
load factor, <em>n</em> is number of items, and <em>N</em> is number of buckets. 
The notation is different but the equation is identical in meaning.
