### Project Presentations

Project presentations will take place in class on 5/1 and 5/6. 
Each presentation should be approximately 7 minutes in length, followed
by 2-3 minutes of questions. You will need to share your screen during 
the presentation, which can include showing and demonstrating your 
program using a terminal, notebook, browser, and/or other windows as
necessary. Your presentation should include the following details:


**1. Project organization**: 
In a browser show your github repository page.
Organize this ahead of time. Ensure your README file clearly states
the name of your project, its intended use, and how to install it. 
While showing this page describe your project goal, and why you chose 
this for your project.


**2. Demonstration**:
Next, demonstrate the current capabilities of your program, even if it is
not yet finished. Your goal is to have a minimal working example that can
accomplish steps 1-n, even if there are many more than n steps in the final
product. (Example, open your terminal and call the command line interface
of your program. Show the options that a user can toggle. And demonstrate
a single run of the program with an example set of input options). In this
section, **your goal is to demonstrate what you have accomplished**, and not 
to focus on what hasn't worked, or what remains to be done. 


**3. Describe basis of code**:
Now that you've demonstrated your code, describe how you went about 
accomplishing this. Start by describing the main dependencies you used.
Have a web browser tab open to the documentation for these libraries, 
and inform your audience *very briefly* about what this package does, 
and why you chose it. (Example, "I wanted to create a 
graphical user interface, and I selected the Python package Kivy to 
accomplish this. Kivy creates GUIs through a combination of Python code
and code blocks describing the visual layout. It is great because it 
can be used for creating GUIs that work on computer screens as well
as on mobile devices. It was difficult to learn because it involved
learning more than just Python code. An example graphical layout file
looks like this, and means this. I'll show you my example next...")


**4. Code details**:
In a text editor open your repository directory. Briefly describe the layout
of your code, for example you created three modules that accomplish tasks
x, y, and z. There is not enough time to describe it all, so instead focus
on a few details. This is meant to be technical. Pick a particular part out
of the code to describe, such as a custom class object you defined, or an 
interesting calculation on a pandas dataframe that you wrote. 
Here **your goal is describe an interesting component of your Python code 
that you spent a lot of time learning, and how it works**. 


**5. Future goals**:
Describe your remaining goals for the project. What steps remain,
and how difficult do you think they will be? Finally, reflect on this
project development experience, including in the context of learning more 
about your peers' projects. What have you learned through this project 
that will make planning or developing your next project easier?

**6. Take questions:**
