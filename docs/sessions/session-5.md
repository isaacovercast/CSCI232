## Icebreaker question
* What is one word that you enjoy, in any language, for whatever reason?
```python
# Define the icebreaker procedure
for student in class:
    response = icebreaker_question()
    if response.isfunny():
        self.laugh()
    elif response.isinteresting():
        self.stroke_chin_thoughfully()
    else:
        self.thumbs_up()
```

## :material-book-variant: Learning objectives
In this session we will learn about the the fundamental elements of the python
programming langauge: variables, lists, and control flow. By the end of this 
session you will be more familiar with the following topics:

- How to assign variables of different data types and perform basic manipulations
- Creating lists and using list indexing and slicing
- Control flow using 'for' loops to iterate over lists

## :material-list-box-outline: Review and Discussion
- Review [homework assignments](https://github.com/iao2122/hack-5-python)
- Link to [Lecture 5 slides](../../lectures/5.0/): Python variables, lists, and for loops

## :material-human-male-board-poll: In class exercises
- Create an account on [genepy.org](https://genepy.org/)
- Work through the first 9 genepy exercises (from 'Hello World' to 'Import')
- Project planning 1: What are the inputs and outputs of the project you have in mind? 
What data is available and what is the 'answer' you want to get out of your tool?

## :material-list-box-outline: Assignments
- Assigned problem set on [python variables, lists, and for loops](../tutorials/5.0-python-part1.md)
- Supplementary Reading and additional practice problems: [30 Days Of Python: Day 10 - Loops](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/10_Day_Loops/10_loops.md)
