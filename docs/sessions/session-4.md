## Icebreaker question
* What is one thing you wish you understood but don't?

## :material-book-variant: Learning objectives
In this session we will learn about using conda for package management and 
we will introduce python as a powerful language for scientific computing.
By the end of this session you will be more familiar with the following topics:

- Installing conda and managing conda environments for installing software
- Launching jupyter notebooks on your local system
- The python programming language for scientific computing


## :material-list-box-outline: Review and Discussion
- Presentations of student GitHub Pages
- Troubleshooting `git`
- Link to [Lecture 4 slides](../../lectures/4.0/): Introducing conda for package management, and the python programming language

## :material-human-male-board-poll: In class exercises
- [Tutorial 4.0: conda installer](../../tutorials/4.0-conda)
- [Tutorial 4.1: jupyter notebook](../../tutorials/4.1-jupyter)

## :material-list-box-outline: Assignments
- Start thinking about a problem you might be interested in developing a tool to solve. Specifically think about what will be the data available (input) and what you want as the answer (output). We will start discussing project ideas next week (in a very preliminary way).
- [Python tutorial chapters 1 and 3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [Tutorial 4.2: GitHub forking and Python assessment](../../tutorials/4.2-forking)
