## Icebreaker question
* What is something you enjoy doing when you are not writing python programs?

## :material-book-variant: Learning objectives
In this session we will learn about more advanced data structures and control
flow mechanisms. By the end of this session you will be more familiar with the
following topics:

- Dictionaries for storing and retrieving key/value pairs
- Conditional branching with if/else statements
- Defining functions to perform specific tasks

## :material-list-box-outline: Review and Discussion
- Continue w/ Project planning discussion for folks who didn't get to go on Tuesday:
What are the inputs and outputs of the project you have in mind? What data is
available and what is the 'answer' you want to get out of your tool?
- Review homework assignments in small groups (2-3 people)
    - For reference, here are our [solutions to Session 5 challenges](https://github.com/iao2122/hack-5-python/blob/main/notebooks/nb-5.3-seesion5-challenges.ipynb)
- Link to [Lecture 6 slides](../../lectures/6.0/): Python dictionaries, conditional statements (if/else), and intro to function definitions

## :material-human-male-board-poll: In class exercises
- In-class microproject: [The Wright-Fisher model](../../tutorials/6.1-microproject-wf)

## :material-list-box-outline: Assignments
- Python tutorial readings:
    - [Chapter 4 (up to and including 4.9.3) on conditionals and functions](https://docs.python.org/3.13/tutorial/controlflow.html)
    - [Chapter 5 (from 5.5 to the end) on Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3.13/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

- Problem sets covering [python dictionaries, conditionals, and functions](../tutorials/6.0-python-part2.md)
- Supplementary Reading and additional practice problems:
    - [30 Days Of Python: Dictionaries](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/08_Day_Dictionaries/08_dictionaries.md)
