    "### The design of REST APIs. \n",
    "The idea behind REST APIs is that data on a server (like a webpage) can be accessed with a consistent type of argument in the form of a URL, to query data which will then be returned in a form that is easy to analyze (usually json or xml), as opposed to being returned in messy HTML that needs to be parsed. Many websites have REST APIs, but some are much easier to use than others. "

    "### Limits\n",
    "Many REST APIs have limits on the way that you can use them. For example, the REST APIs for Twitter, GitHub, and Reddit require that you login in order to access data, and some sites will throttle how many requests you can make per hour. In this notebook we will be focusing on accessing data from websites that *are designed to be queried* -- they purposefully created an API for this purpose. It's worth noting that there exists other methods to parse data from the raw HTML representation of websites, but that is not our focus here. By contrast, sites with API access typically have data stored in a server database that allows efficient access to even enormous datasets with billions of records (e.g., Twitter)."

Two very good examples are the [USDA Bison API](https://bison.usgs.gov/#api) and the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary). We'll focus on the latter in this notebook. The GBIF database is an international effort to collect all observation data on plants, animals, and fungi into a single place where it can be searched. It is actually a conglomeration of many separate databases, with data from museums and similar institutions all over the world. These APIs are free to use but request that you cite them if the data is used in a publication eventually. \n",

    "### What does GBIF do?\n",
    "GBIF can be used to find specimen collection records, or other types of observation data, stored in museum type databases. The website offers a convenient way to request taxa by name, and to select specific research criteria. For example, if we wanted to find all specimens of bumblebees (genus *Bombus*) that were collected between 1910 and 1920 we could request this through the website. It will draw a nice map with their locations and you can download a table with coordinates of where they were collected. This is actually one of the best databases around, since it organizes the data quite easily for you to download, but nevertheless, we'll use it as our example to learn REST APIs. "

    "### REST APIs and websites\n",
    "It's worth noting that the GBIF website itself is designed around the REST API. When you fill in the search form on the site to tell it to search a particular species from a particular area, its response is collected from the database in the same way that your response would be when you make the same request using a URL passed to the API. The website simply takes this response (likely in JSON format) and renders it nicely into a table or map for you to view on the website. This is how many websites work!"

For GBIF the default number, shown under the \"limit\" key, is 20. And the default starting position, shown under \"offset\" is 0. The total number of records is in \"count\".
